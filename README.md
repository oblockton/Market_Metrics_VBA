# The VBA of Wall Street

## Background

 In this assignment I have been tasked with using VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. Depending on comfort level with VBA, we were given multiple options of assignment difficulty: Easy, Moderate, or Hard below. I chose to complete the Hard option, including the additional challenge functionality. Explanations of task to be completed at each difficulty level are provided below.

### Files

* [Stock Data](Multiple_year_stock_data_complete.xlsx) - Macro-Enabled workbook containing the project data and scripts.

### Stock market analyst

### Easy

* Create a script that will loop through each year of stock data and grab the total amount of volume each stock had over the year.

* You will also need to display the ticker symbol to coincide with the total volume.

* Your result should look as follows (note: all solution images are for 2015 data).

### Moderate

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks and take the following info.

  * Yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was.

  * The percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed.

  * The total Volume of the stock

  * Ticker symbol

* You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

* The result should look as follows.

* Your solution will include everything from the moderate challenge.

* Your solution will also be able to locate the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

* Solution will look as follows.

### CHALLENGE

* Make the appropriate adjustments to your script that will allow it to run on every worksheet just by running it once.

* This can be applied to any of the difficulties.

### Other Considerations

* Make sure that the script acts the same on each sheet.
